            You’ve heard the phrase: "AI won't replace you, but a person using AI will." It’s a catchy line, but is it the whole story? It feels like overnight, everyone became an AI expert. People who rarely gave advice to students are now suddenly thought leaders on a technology that is, for most, a black box.

          <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl">The Marketing Machine</h2>
          <p>
            Let's be honest: a lot of what we're seeing is just marketing. Companies have invested billions, and they need a return. So they sell a dream of effortless productivity and boundless creativity. But when you look closer, you start to see the cracks. Many who jumped on the trend are realizing that while AI is a powerful tool, it's not the magic wand they were promised. How many times a day do you really need to generate a picture of an astronaut riding a unicorn?

          <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl">The Hidden Costs</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond the hype, there are practical realities. Training and running these massive AI models require enormous server capacity, which translates to staggering energy and financial costs. For many companies, hiring a skilled human is still more cost-effective than relying on an expensive, power-hungry AI system. The real value seems to be in augmentation, not replacement. Giving a powerful tool to a creative human can unlock new potential.

            But this brings a new concern. As AI makes work "eas жан" and "faster," we must be careful that it doesn't become a tool for exploitation. The pressure to produce more, simply because the AI can handle it, can lead to burnout and devalue human labor. AI should be our assistant, not our master. It's a supportive tool, but true progress, true creativity, still comes from the human mind. The hype train is loud, but it's important to listen to the quiet hum of reality.
