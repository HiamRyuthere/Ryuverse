            Have you ever noticed yourself sharing every feeling and thought with AI? Whether it's about how to reply to your crush or how to behave in a situation, if yes, there is a high chance that you are addicted to AI. 
            AI is like a friend who is always there for you, but it can also become a crutch that you rely on too much. Let's try to understand how AI addiction works and how to overcome it.

          <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl">Why It's Not So Cool to Have AI Addiction?</h2>
          <p>
            Why is it even important? What's the problem if we are telling everything to AI and getting answers? 
            First of all, you are actually under an illusion if you think AI is giving you personalized answers. 
            It's trained on a vast amount of data and simply provides answers based on past occurrences, often sugar-coated in a way that feels good to you. You might believe it's personalized advice, but it's not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another concern is your data. When you share everything with AI, your information is stored somewhere—maybe, or maybe not; we don't know. 
            But what we do know is that we are providing enough information for someone to track our digital behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, it doesn't really help you grow. You will often notice that artificial intelligence always agrees with you, no matter what you say. 
            While sugar-coating can be comforting, we need a reality check in life sometimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not a psychologist or a medical professional, but it's just my personal thought that this could happen. 
            When you are constantly talking to artificial intelligence, it may affect your normal relationships with humans because you will become addicted to someone who listens to you and gives you the answers you want to hear.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl">How to Use AI Wisely?</h2>
          <p>While AI can be addictive, it is also a necessity in today's modern world. So how can we use AI without becoming addicted?</p>
          <p>If you hear reasons like <b>“It's for information purposes, not for emotional support,”</b> take them seriously.</p>
          <p>Here's a trick that I found personally helpful: <b>Use AI that is not personalized and fine-tuned to you.</b> 
            Yes, you heard it correctly; it is that simple. You can use artificial intelligence that does not store everything about you but still provides answers based on your queries. 
            Of course, you can store some information like your professional background and how you prefer to receive answers, but mainly it should be just basic details like your preferred language for responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good AI for this purpose that I personally use is Duck.ai. You can also download your own AI from Ollama or just use ChatGPT in a minimal instruction mode. 
            <br /><b>In the end, I can quote: “As long as your prompt is big, you are good; if your prompt is short, you need to work on it.”</b>
